    "In general, how an optimization problem is solved depends on its categorization (categories include Linear Programming, Quadratic Programming, Mixed-integer Programming, etc.). Categorization depends on properties of both the cost function $f(x)$ and the constraint set $\\mathcal{S}$. For example, if the cost function $f(x)$ is a linear function of $x$, and the constraint $\\mathcal{S}$ is a linear set $\\mathcal{S} = \\{x | Ax\\le b\\}$, then we have a *linear programming* problem, which is efficiently solved with certain solvers. \n",
